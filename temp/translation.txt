I originally believed that my account was permanently inaccessible due to a mistaken operation, so I attempted to register a new account using a different email address. Later, I learned that the original account could actually be restored. This misunderstanding led to the creation of multiple accounts. I hope you understand my situation and kindly assist me in restoring my original account.
